## WHAT

This is a personal website of the standard pre-posthumanist human.

## WHO

We are defined by the way the reader (here, in the structuralist tradition, I am talking about reading what we consider reality, which is in fact a representation of such) interprets the sets of symbols we project. We attempt to influence that perception by curating the collection of symbols, which we believe represents us. Below is my collection of symbols in no particular order and with no guarantee of stability:

### Academic:

- Post-humanism
- HCI
- Post-structuralism
- Subcultures

### Computing:

- Python
- Golang
- Elm
- zsh
- Cypher/GQL -- SPARQL
- GANN and computational linguistics

### Aesthetic:

- Japanese underground comics (60s, 70s, 80s)
- Installation

### Athletic:
- ~~tri~~
- Epeé

### Ethic:
Government is an institute of oppression vested with the exclusive right to exert violence against own citizens. Considering that the government is represented by individuals, who's position is relativley unstable, we are in the situation of unresolvable conflict of interests. 

## ITEMS

There are couple of things I did that I belive someone may find useful beyond simple utilitarian use (like some software, which I also did, but links to which I will not attach)

- [The Ramayana — the jorney on the edges, node by node](https://github.com/evilcloud/The_Ramayana) is a graph construct in pure Cypher of each character, item, event and relation in the Ancient Indian epic The Ramayana
- [Death Grips simulator](https://github.com/evilcloud/Death-Grips-simulator) is a study of a band's revolt against visual hegemony in popular culture (whether deliberate or not is not is irrelevant here). Includes the actual paper (in <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LaTeX"> format)

_work in progress_
